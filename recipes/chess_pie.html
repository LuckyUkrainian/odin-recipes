    <h1>Chess Pie</h1>
    <p><img src="../img/chess_pie.jpeg" alt="Chess Pie"></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chess pie is a very old Southern recipe. It's a very sweet, rich dessert which cannot be described as anything but marvelous. This is not my personal recipe but was passed to me by my grandmother and from her grandmother and so on and so forth. You will think you have died and gone to heaven when you taste this, especially when served with whipped cream.</p>
